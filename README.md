# Transformer Implementation in C++

This project implements a basic version of the Transformer model using C++. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), has revolutionized the field of natural language processing and is widely used in tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and more.
